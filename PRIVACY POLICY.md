### **COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**
To use the app's features, a student account's gradebook system login credentials must be provided. This information or any other information displayed in the app will be retained on your device only and is not collected or viewable by me in any way. This application uses credentials you supply to retrieve and display grade and class information from your gradebook system server directly. 

### **DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**
We do not give your data to any third-party service providers as we do not store any of your personal data.

### **SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.  While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.  Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
 
### **LINKS TO OTHER SITES**
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.
